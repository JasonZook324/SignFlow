# Business Plan

## 1. Problem & Solution
Problem: Service providers lose time assembling proposals, collecting signatures, and chasing payments.
Solution: Streamlined end-to-end workflow: build proposal, send, legally sign, collect payment—fast, branded, auditable.

## 2. Target Segments (Initial Niche Focus)
Primary Beachhead: Creative agencies (design, marketing) 1–20 seats
Secondary: Freelance consultants, boutique SaaS agencies
Later Expansion: Photographers, construction estimators, B2B service firms

## 3. Unique Value Proposition
- Faster conversion: track views + smart reminders reduce time-to-sign
- Integrated payment at signature moment boosts cash collection
- Legal, tamper-evident audit trail without enterprise complexity
- Niche-tailored templates shorten creation time

## 4. Revenue Model
Subscription Tiers (Monthly / Annual -2 months)
- Starter ($19 / $190): 10 proposals, 5 e-signatures, basic PDF, Stripe CC payments
- Pro ($49 / $490): Unlimited proposals, 50 signatures, branding, client portal, ACH, analytics
- Business ($149 / $1,490): Unlimited signatures, multi-party routing, white-label domain, API/webhooks, SSO (later), advanced reports
Add-ons:
- Extra signatures ($0.50 each beyond quota)
- Additional storage (PDF/media) tiers
- Seats beyond included (eg. Pro includes 5, $8/seat additional)
Future: Template marketplace revenue share (20%)

## 5. Pricing Justification
Anchored against competitors charging $50–$80 for similar features; entry pricing targets rapid adoption with upsell path (analytics, white-label, API). Annual discount drives upfront cash and reduces churn.

## 6. Go-To-Market (First 90 Days)
Phase 1 (Pre-MVP)
- Landing page (value proposition + email capture)
- Publish 5 free niche proposal templates (SEO + lead magnet)
Phase 2 (MVP Live)
- Outreach: curated list of 200 agencies (personalized cold emails + template link)
- Social proof: early adopter testimonials & logos
- Content: Blog posts (How to reduce time-to-sign, Pricing strategy template)
Phase 3 (Scale)
- Partnership: agency communities, design tool bundles
- PPC (low budget) targeting “proposal + payments”
- Integration co-marketing (HubSpot QuickBooks sync)

## 7. Activation Funnel
Steps: Visit -> Sign up -> Create Proposal -> Send -> Client Views -> Client Signs -> Payment
Instrumentation:
- Time from signup to first proposal
- Drop-off rates (builder abandonment, unsent proposals, unsigned)
Optimization:
- In-app guided checklist
- Template suggestion during empty state
- Reminder automation (24h, 72h, expiry)

## 8. Retention & Expansion
Retention Levers:
- Monthly proposal performance email (wins, conversion rate)
- New template drops
- Usage insights surface upsell prompts
Expansion:
- Seat expansion triggered by >80% seat utilization
- White-label + custom domain prompts after brand asset uploads
- API upsell when manual data export used

## 9. Churn Mitigation
- Exit survey + immediate discount counter-offer (soft save)
- Data export (one-click) builds trust
- “Dormant proposal” reactivation suggestions
- Slack-style grace period (non-paying read-only 30 days)

## 10. Key Metrics
Acquisition:
- Site -> Signup Conversion %
- Cost per lead (CPL)
Activation:
- Time-to-first-proposal (median)
- View -> Sign conversion %
Revenue:
- MRR, Expansion MRR %, Net Revenue Churn %
Engagement:
- Active orgs/week
- Proposal creation rate/org
Retention:
- Logo Churn %, Gross Revenue Churn %
Efficiency:
- Support tickets per 100 active orgs
- Infrastructure cost / MRR

## 11. Year 1 Financial Outline (Indicative)
Targets:
- End Users (paying orgs): 300
- ARPU (blended): $42
- MRR: ~$12,600 at month 12
Cost Buckets (Monthly steady-state):
- Infra (Azure, email, PDF): $1,200
- Support & Success (1 part-time): $2,000
- Marketing (ads, tools, content): $3,000
- Misc/Overhead: $800
Gross Margin > 80% projected post-scale.

## 12. Competitive Landscape
Categories:
- General proposal tools (PandaDoc, Proposify)
- E-sign (DocuSign, HelloSign) lacking integrated pricing flow
Differentiation: Niche templates + integrated pricing + payment at signature moment + accessible API middle tier.

## 13. Expansion Roadmap (Post-90 Days)
- Marketplace (industry clauses, template packs)
- Milestone & subscription billing from proposals
- CRM auto-sync (HubSpot -> proposal auto-draft)
- AI pricing optimization (upsell detection)
- International tax (VAT/GST) compliance
- Multi-language proposal rendering

## 14. Risks & Mitigation
- Feature commoditization: accelerate niche-specific template library
- Payment disputes: implement optional client acceptance checkbox + detailed line item descriptions
- Regulatory (e-sign): maintain ESIGN/UETA compliance artifacts (consent capture, immutable audit)
- Cash flow: encourage annual pre-pay with onboarding incentive

## 15. Customer Success Motion
Onboarding:
- In-app guided tour + sample proposal autofill
- Day 2 email: “Send your first proposal” prompt
Ongoing:
- Monthly metrics report
- Quarterly webinar (new features)
Support:
- In-app help widget, <24h response time
- Prioritized support for Business tier

## 16. Marketing Assets Checklist
- Landing page + pricing
- Blog engine (CMS minimal)
- Template gallery (download gated by email)
- Case study PDF
- Comparison page vs competitor (SEO)
- Changelog page (signals velocity)

## 17. Sales Assist (Lightweight)
- Self-serve checkout (Stripe)
- Business tier inquiry form -> Calendly
- Security & compliance datasheet PDF
- API docs public (drives technical adoption)

## 18. Monetization Experiments
- Trial length A/B (14 vs 21 days)
- Usage-based signature pack pre-purchase
- “Urgent signing” SMS credits
- AI content assist billed per token bundle (future)

## 19. Exit / Long-Term Strategy
Paths:
- Remain profitable Micro-SaaS (owner dividends)
- Expand to full CPQ + contract lifecycle
- Potential acquisition by proposals/e-sign incumbents or vertical SaaS (agency tooling)

## 20. Implementation Alignment
Business-critical features prioritized early (signature, payment) to validate value; advanced analytics & integrations post product-market fit.
